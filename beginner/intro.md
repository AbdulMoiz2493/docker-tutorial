# Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for running applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an app with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.

---

## Containers vs. VMs

- **Containers**: Share the host OS, lightweight, fast.
- **Virtual Machines**: Include a full OS, heavier, slower.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Image**: A read-only template for containers (e.g., `node:18-slim`).
- **Container**: A running instance of an image.
- **Dockerfile**: A script to build images.
- **Docker Hub**: A registry for sharing images.

---

## Why Use Docker?

- **Portability**: Run apps anywhere Docker is installed.
- **Consistency**: Same environment in development and production.
- **Scalability**: Deploy multiple containers easily.

## Next Steps

- **Install Docker**: See [installation.md](installation.md).
- **Run your first container**: See [commands.md](commands.md).
